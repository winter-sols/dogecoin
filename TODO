Done:

Compatibility with Qt, and some more modularity

- Put guard statements around header files.

- Proper include between header files; remove central "header.h" file.

- Removed macro foreach: conflicts with Qt keyword foreach, replaced back with BOOST_FOREACH

- Prefix stdlib structures and functions with std:: in headers; "using namespace" in header files is
   generally frowned upon

Todo:

- Repeated in all files?
#define __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS // to enable UINT64_MAX from stdint.h
#include "main.h"
#ifndef GUI
#include "noui.h"
#endif

- Check windows support / cross platform
