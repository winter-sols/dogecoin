    ** Table should be the same in all tabs. Do we really need different widgets?
       -> yes, to have different proxy views

    ** Table rows are much too high?

Done:

To be able to make an external GUI, I am working on modularizing bitcoin into a library. This is basic code
plumbing, 100% no functional changes.

- Put guard statements around header files.

- Removed macro foreach: conflicts with Qt4 keyword `foreach`, replaced with BOOST_FOREACH.

- Prefix stdlib structures and functions with std:: in headers; "using namespace" in header files is
   generally frowned upon. These are moved to the implementation files.

- Modularity: base48.h and most other header files can now be included without the other shebang
   (useful for linking external GUI to bitcoin core, part of GUI separation).
  The include files that need each other now include each other.


Todo:

- Repeated in all files?
#define __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS // to enable UINT64_MAX from stdint.h
#include "main.h"
#ifndef GUI
#include "noui.h"
#endif

- Check windows support / cross platform
