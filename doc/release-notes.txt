Bitcoin Improvement Proposals implemented
-----------------------------------------
BIP 22 - 'getblocktemplate', 'submitblock' RPCs
BIP 34 - block version 2, height in coinbase
BIP 35 - 'mempool' message, extended 'getdata' message behavior


Core bitcoin handling and blockchain database
---------------------------------------------
* Reduced CPU usage, by eliminating some redundant hash calculations
* Cache signature verifications, to eliminate redundant signature checks
* Transactions with zero-value outputs are considered non-standard
* Mining: when creating new blocks, sort 'paid' area by fee-per-kb
* Database: better validation of on-disk stored data
* Database: minor optimizations and reliability improvements
* -loadblock=FILE will import an external block file
* Additional DoS prevention measures


JSON-RPC API
------------
* Internal HTTP server is now thread-per-connection, rather than
  a single-threaded queue that would stall on network I/O.
* Internal HTTP server supports HTTP/1.1, pipelined requests and
  connection keep-alive.
* Support JSON-RPC 2.0 batches, to encapsulate multiple JSON-RPC requests
  within a single HTTP request.
* IPv6 support
* Added raw transaction API.  See https://gist.github.com/2839617
* Added 'getrawmempool', to list contents of TX memory pool
* Added 'getpeerinfo', to list data about each connected network peer
* Added 'listaddressgroupings' for better coin control
* Rework gettransaction, getblock calls. 'gettransaction' responds for
  non-wallet TXs now.
* Remove deprecated RPC 'getblocknumber'
* New blockchain checkpoint at block 193,000
* listtransactions output now displays "smart" times for transactions,
  and 'blocktime' and 'timereceived' fields were added


P2P networking
--------------
* IPv6 support
* Tor/I2P hidden service support
* Attempts to fix "stuck blockchain download" problems
* Replace BDB database "addr.dat" with internally-managed "peers.dat"
  file containing peer address data.
* Lower default send buffer from 10MB to 1MB
* proxy: SOCKS5 by default
* Support connecting by hostnames passed to proxy (-proxydns)
* Add -seednode connections, and use this for -dnsseed + -proxydns
* Added -externalip and -discover
* Add -onlynet to prevent connections to a given network
* Separate listening sockets, -bind=<addr>


Qt GUI
---------------------
?????


Internal codebase
-----------------
* Additional unit tests
* Compile warning fixes


Miscellaneous
-------------
* Reopen debug.log upon SIGHUP
* Bash programmable completion for bitcoind(1)
* On supported OS's, each thread is given a useful name
