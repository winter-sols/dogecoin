Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

RPC changes
-----------

The first positional argument of `createrawtransaction` was renamed.
This interface change breaks compatibility with 0.14.0, when the named
arguments functionality, introduced in 0.14.0, is used.


Mining
------

Getblocktemplate sets the segwit version bit even when the downstream
client has not been updated to include the segwit commitment.  Ability
to enforce the rule is the only required criteria for safe activation,
but previously signaling was only requested if the miner could include
transactions in order to avoid a potential outcome where segwit would
activate at a time when no segwit transactions could be included.
Since many miners are now including the segwit commitment this concern
no longer applies.
