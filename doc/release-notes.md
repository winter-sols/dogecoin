bitcoin-cli: arguments privacy
--------------------------------

The RPC command line client gained a new argument, `-stdin`
to read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D.
For example:

    $ echo -e "mysecretcode\n120" | src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase

It is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet
passphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process
table by any user on the system.
