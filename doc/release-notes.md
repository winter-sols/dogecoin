Notable changes
===============

Example item
----------------


bitcoin-cli: arguments privacy
--------------------------------

The RPC command line client gained a new argument, `-stdin`
to read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D.
For example:

    $ echo -e "mysecretcode\n120" | src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase

It is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet
passphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process
table by any user on the system.

RPC low-level changes
----------------------

- `gettxoutsetinfo` UTXO hash (`hash_serialized`) has changed. There was a divergence between
  32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and the txids were missing in the hashed data. This has been
  fixed, but this means that the output will be different than from previous versions.

0.13.0 Change log
=================

Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect
behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating
the code changes and accompanying discussion, both the pull request and
git merge commit are mentioned.

### RPC and REST

Asm script outputs now contain OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY in place of OP_NOP2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by [BIP 
65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki)

The following outputs are affected by this change:
- RPC `getrawtransaction` (in verbose mode)
- RPC `decoderawtransaction`
- RPC `decodescript`
- REST `/rest/tx/` (JSON format)
- REST `/rest/block/` (JSON format when including extended tx details)
- `bitcoin-tx -json`

### Configuration and command-line options

### Block and transaction handling

### P2P protocol and network code

The p2p alert system has been removed in #7692 and the 'alert' message is no longer supported.


Fee filtering of invs (BIP 133)
------------------------------------

The optional new p2p message "feefilter" is implemented and the protocol
version is bumped to 70013. Upon receiving a feefilter message from a peer,
a node will not send invs for any transactions which do not meet the filter
feerate. [BIP 133](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0133.mediawiki)
